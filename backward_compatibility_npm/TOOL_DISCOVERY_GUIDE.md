# Npm Tool Discovery Guide

Comprehensive guide to discovering and utilizing all Npm capabilities using proven methodologies.

## üéØ Discovery Methodology

This system implements proven patterns from ESP32-C6 VESC Express project, providing:
- **Multi-layered Discovery**: Convenience scripts, analytics, documentation, slash commands
- **Smart Recommendations**: Context-aware suggestions based on project state
- **Usage Analytics**: Learning from patterns to optimize workflows
- **Cross-platform Support**: Works on Linux, macOS, Windows (WSL2)

## üîç Discovery Layers

### 1. Convenience Script Discovery
```bash
./npm_ultimate discover   # Show all capabilities
./npm_ultimate suggest    # Context-aware recommendations
./npm_ultimate             # Full help system
```

### 2. Analytics-Driven Discovery
```bash
./npm_analytics_report.sh # Usage insights
# Automatically suggests underutilized features
# Recommends optimizations based on patterns
```

### 3. Claude Code Integration
```bash
# In Claude Code, type:
/npm-discover    # Comprehensive tool exploration
/npm-analyze     # Advanced analysis
/npm-troubleshoot # Problem resolution
```

### 4. Documentation Discovery
- `TEAM_ONBOARDING.md` - Getting started guide
- `CROSS_PLATFORM_COMPATIBILITY.md` - Platform support
- `ANALYTICS_AND_OPTIMIZATION.md` - Performance insights

## ü§ñ Smart Recommendation Engine

### Context Analysis
The system analyzes:
- Project configuration state
- Service running status
- Usage history patterns
- Error frequency
- Performance metrics

### Recommendation Types
1. **Immediate Actions**: High-priority items requiring attention
2. **Optimization Opportunities**: Performance improvements
3. **Learning Suggestions**: Discover new capabilities
4. **Best Practices**: Follow proven patterns

### Examples
```bash
# No configuration detected
üéØ Recommended: ./npm_ultimate setup

# Service not running
üéØ Recommended: ./npm_ultimate start

# High usage detected
üéØ Recommended: ./npm_ultimate optimize
```

## üìä Analytics Integration

### Usage Tracking

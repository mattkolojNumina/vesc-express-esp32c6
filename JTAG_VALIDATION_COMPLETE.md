# ESP32-C6 JTAG Debugging Validation Summary

## âœ… Issues Identified and Fixed:

### 1. Original GDB Connection Error
**Error**: 'Remote replied unexpectedly to 'vMustReplyEmpty': vCont;c;C;s;S'
**Root Cause**: Protocol mismatch between GDB and OpenOCD due to missing ELF file

### 2. Build System Issues
**Error**: App partition too small for binary (0x153b30 > 0x100000)
**Fix Applied**: 
- Updated partitions.csv with larger app0 partition (0x200000)
- Adjusted partition layout for ESP32-C6 4MB flash
- Successfully generated project.elf (13.2MB)

### 3. JTAG Debugging Environment
**Status**: âœ… FULLY OPERATIONAL
- OpenOCD v0.12.0-esp32-20250707 running
- ESP32-C6 USB JTAG detected (303a:1001)
- GDB server listening on port 3333
- Target halted at PC=0x40808D0E

## âœ… Validation Results:

### Hardware Connectivity
- ESP32-C6 JTAG TAP detected (0x0000dc25)
- 2 RISC-V harts found (XLEN=32)
- Clock speed: 6000 kHz
